- DNA Cloud 3.2 is an updated version of DNA Cloud 3.14. In this software, the user can use two different algorithms i.e. Goldman and Golay to encode/decode any types of files.

- This version includes the number of chunks of actual DNA required to store the given data, the type of files(Ex. `.jpg`, `.txt`), and the method name which is used to encode the file. This info will be available in the .dnac file generated while encoding.

- This version also includes the barcode and the QR code which store the following details:

> 1. File Name
> 2. User Name
> 3. User's Contact Number
> 4. Unique Sample ID

- DNA Cloud has been developed to generate a user-friendly, interactive environment for users to envisage their DNA data storage.

- Research in our lab currently focuses on two aspects of information processing viz. deciphering the information processing principles in life (systems biology) and building a computer out of bio-molecules (synthetic biology). The key expertise of the lab is in error-correcting codes. We also work in classical and quantum information processing principles with expertise in coding theory and its wide variety of applications in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 

- Our research areas include mathematics and its elegant applications in Emerging Technologies: DNA digital data storage, DNA computing, chemical computing, coding theory, quantum computing, quantum machine learning, quantum error correction, cryptography, quantum algorithms, synthetic biology, DNA nanotechnology, and bioinformatics.

- Visit [guptalab.org](guptalab.org) to know more about our work in the area of emerging technologies and explore various other software.
